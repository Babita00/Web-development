        <p class="position">
            Position and order of appearance: The order in which your CSS rules appear
            If there are two rules that have selectors of identical specificity, the last one to be declared won.
        </p>
        <p class="Specificity">
        Specificity: In algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match.
        CSS specificity determines which style rules get applied to an element when there are conflicts.
        Higher specificity means the style will be used.
        It's calculated based on a point system involving inline styles, IDs, classes, and tag names.
        </p>
        <p class="Origin">
            Origin: The order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a
            browser extension, or your authored CSS
        </p>
        <p class="Importance">
            Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type.
            The !important flag in CSS is used to give a particular style rule the highest level of importance,
            overriding any other competing styles.
            When you add !important to a CSS rule, it will take precedence over
            other rules affecting the same element, regardless of their specificity. For example, if you have:
        </p>
