    <h1>Asynchronous</h1>
    It allows to execute instruction immediately.
    <P>
        Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get
        blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
        Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions
        immediately and doesn't block the flow.
    </P>
